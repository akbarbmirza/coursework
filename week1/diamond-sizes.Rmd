```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE
)

smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only 
`r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than
2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown
below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```

> There are `r count(diamonds)` diamonds in our data set. We have various peaks around 0.3 carats, 0.6 carats, and 1.0 carats. Diamonds with a carat size of `r diamonds %>% group_by(carat) %>% summarize(count=n()) %>% arrange(desc(count)) %>% select(carat) %>% head(1) %>% max()` are the most popular.
