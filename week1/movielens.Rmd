Read data from the `ratings.csv` file

Loaded `r format(object.size(ratings), units="Mb")` of ratings data, containing `r format(nrow(ratings), big.mark = ",")` ratings. Here's a preview:

# Summary statistics

```{r dist-ratings}

  geom_histogram() +
  scale_y_continuous(label = comma)

## Per-movie stats

```{r aggregate-by-movie}
# aggregate ratings by movie, computing mean and number of ratings
# hint: use the n() function for easy counting within a group
ratings %>% group_by(movie_id) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(rating), count = n())
```

```{r dist-movie-popularity}
# plot distribution of movie popularity (= number of ratings the movie received)

```{r cdf-movie-pop}

# store the result in a new data frame so you can use it in creating figure 2 from the paper below
ranked_ratings <- ratings %>% group_by(movie_id) %>%
  summarize(avg_rating = mean(rating), count = n()) %>%

# Anatomy of the long tail

```{r long-tail}
# generate the equivalent of figure 2 of this paper:
# https://5harad.com/papers/long_tail.pdf

# Specifically, for the subset of users who rated at least 10 movies,
# produce a plot that shows the fraction of users satisfied (vertical
# axis) as a function of inventory size (horizontal axis). We will
# define "satisfied" as follows: an individual user is satisfied p% of
# the time at inventory of size k if at least p% of the movies they
# rated are contained in the top k most popular movies. As in the
# paper, produce one curve for the 100% user satisfaction level and
# another for 90%---do not, however, bother implementing the null
# model (shown in the dashed lines).

# compute rank of weirdest movie each person rates - join ratings with movie pop - group_by user and max(rank)
